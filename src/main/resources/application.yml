# Default UrbanDataset configuration
ud:
  # Maximum number of lines to include in a single UrbanDataset. When the
  # number of values exceeds this threshold the conversion will automatically
  # generate multiple UD files with suffixed names (e.g., _1, _2). A value of
  # 0 or a negative value means no limit (all rows in a single UD).
  maxRowsPerUd: 1000
  dst:
    # Policy for selecting which occurrence to keep when an overlap occurs during DST rollback.
    # KEEP_LATER means keep the later (standard time) instant. KEEP_EARLIER would keep the
    # earlier (daylight saving) instant. Currently unused when utcUd is fixed.
    overlapPolicy: KEEP_LATER
    # Policy to handle gaps during DST switch forward. SHIFT_FORWARD moves timestamps
    # into the next valid time. SHIFT_FORWARD_COMPRESS compresses the timeline by applying
    # a one-hour negative correction to all subsequent timestamps once the boundary is reached.
    # SKIP would skip these periods entirely. Currently unused when udUtc is fixed.
